.SH NOTES
.P
Abbreviations should be short, easy to remember and hard to trigger accidentally.
.P
It helps if an abbreviation includes either a key word from the fully expanded text, or an initialization or acronym that is part of it.
.P
For example, if you regularly wrote "Snippet Pixie" ðŸ˜‰ you might use "\fBsp\fR".
.P
However, there are a lot of words that include the letter combination "\fBsp\fR", (see https://www.wordfind.com/contains/sp/), so there's a reasonably high chance that Snippet Pixie would expand that abbreviation when you didn't want it to.
.P
So instead it's common to add a "\fBtrigger character\fR" to the end of the abbreviation. This is commonly a character that isn't found in normal sentences such as "\fB`\fR" or "\fB~\fR" that is easy to find on your keyboard. Often just appending a space is enough, or doubling up characters.
.P
I personally use "\fB`\fR" (commonly known as grav or backtick) a lot as it's a single keystroke on my British layout keyboard just below my Escape key. So for me "\fBsp`\fR" is a natural abbreviation for "\fBSnippet Pixie\fR".
.P
However, I could see using "\fBsp \fR" or "\fBspp\fR" for the abbreviation.
.P
If you do use a trailing space as your trigger character you might find it useful to include a trailing space in the text that is expanded, e.g. "\fBsp \fR" expands to "\fBSnippet Pixie \fR" as it's more natural when typing.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Auto-expansion only works on accessible applications, use the shortcut to open the search and paste window for other applications such as browsers and Electron based apps.
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Auto-expansion does not work in terminals, but the shortcut method works with terminals that accept \fBCtrl\fR+\fBv\fR for paste such as the elementary OS terminal.
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

The cursor placeholder is not supported when using the shortcut method rather than auto-expansion.
