# NOTES

Abbreviations should be short, easy to remember and hard to trigger accidentally.

It helps if an abbreviation includes either a key word from the fully expanded text, or an initialization or acronym that is part of it.

For example, if you regularly wrote "Snippet Pixie" ðŸ˜‰ you might use "*sp*".

However, there are a lot of words that include the letter combination "*sp*", (see https://www.wordfind.com/contains/sp/), so there's a reasonably high chance that Snippet Pixie would expand that abbreviation when you didn't want it to.

So instead it's common to add a "*trigger character*" to the end of the abbreviation. This is commonly a character that isn't found in normal sentences such as "*`*" or "*~*" that is easy to find on your keyboard. Often just appending a space is enough, or doubling up characters.

I personally use "*`*" (commonly known as grav or backtick) a lot as it's a single keystroke on my British layout keyboard just below my Escape key. So for me "*sp`*" is a natural abbreviation for "*Snippet Pixie*".

However, I could see using "*sp *" or "*spp*" for the abbreviation.

If you do use a trailing space as your trigger character you might find it useful to include a trailing space in the text that is expanded, e.g. "*sp *" expands to "*Snippet Pixie *" as it's more natural when typing.

# LIMITATIONS

- Auto-expansion only works on accessible applications, use the shortcut to open the search and paste window for other applications such as browsers and Electron based apps.
- Auto-expansion does not work in terminals, but the shortcut method works with terminals that accept *Ctrl*+*v* for paste such as the elementary OS terminal.
- The cursor placeholder is not supported when using the shortcut method rather than auto-expansion.
