snippetpixie-placeholders - placeholders that can be used in snippetpixie abbreviation bodies
.P
.SH SYNTAX
.P
All placeholders are delimited (wrapped) by \fB$$\fR, with the placeholder name starting with an \fB@\fR symbol.
.P
For example, today's date can be inserted with \fB$$@date$$\fR.
.P
Some placeholders allow for extra arguments when \fB:\fR follows their name and that is followed by the argument. For example a format for a date, or the abbreviation for a snippet. Check the following descriptions for each placeholder for more details.
.P
To use \fB$$\fR in your snippet body, escape the second \fB$\fR with a backslash like so: \fB$\\$\fR.
.P
.SH @DATE & @TIME
.P
Quick Examples:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Today's date with system format: \fB$$@date$$\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Today's date with custom format: \fB$$@date:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S$$\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Tomorrow's date with system format: \fB$$@date@+1D$$\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Date 2 weeks from today with custom format: \fB$$@date@+2W:%x$$\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Time 3 hours from now: \fB$$@time@+3H$$\fR

.RE
.P
\fB@time\fR is an alias for \fB@date\fR, with one important difference, the default output if no format specified is the default time format (\fB%X\fR) rather than default date format (\fB%x\fR).
.P
The optional format specified after \fB:\fR can take a format string as detailed in the GLib.DateTime.format function's docs, see https://valadoc.org/glib-2.0/GLib.DateTime.format.html.
.P
The optional date calculation starts with an \fB@\fR after the placeholder name, followed by a signed integer and unit. The unit types are as follows:

.P
You can apply more than one date calculation, for example \fB+2h+30m\fR adds 2 hours and 30 minutes to the current time.
.P
You can use both positive (\fB+\fR) and negative calculations, for example \fB-3D\fR takes 3 days from the current date.
.P
.SH @CLIPBOARD
.P
When \fB$$@clipboard$$\fR is part of a snippet's body, when its abbreviation is expanded the current text contents of the clipboard will replace the placeholder.
.P
.SH @SNIPPET
.P
You can have up to three levels of embedded snippets with the \fB@snippet\fR placeholder.
.P
The abbreviation for the snippet to be embedded is entered after \fB:\fR, for example \fB$$@snippet:sigg;$$\fR expands the snippet with abbreviation \fBsigg;\fR in place of the placeholder.
.P
.SH @CURSOR
.P
Adding \fB$$@cursor$$\fR to a snippet's body will put the cursor in its place after expansion instead of at the end of the expanded text.
.P
If \fB$$@cursor$$\fR is entered more than once in a snippet's body or via snippet embedding, then the last occurrence of the cursor placeholder wins.
.P
The @cursor placeholder does not work when using the shortcut to open the search and paste window rather than auto-expansion.
